Hello! I'm Wellington, a Data Scientist with hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Generative AI (LLMs, RAG), and Data Analytics, building end-to-end data solutions for real-world problems.

I work across the full data lifecycle, from data collection and processing to modeling, automation, and interactive dashboards, using Python and SQL as core tools. My projects span areas such as AI-powered assistants, predictive models, data pipelines, and analytics applications.

Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Accounting, which complements my technical background with strong business and analytical foundations.
